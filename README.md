# Automation
This section offers tools for Linux Technical Writers to automate those tasks to be more efficient and possibly save time. An example is a scrot script to take sreen captures. We offer a front end to edit the variable of "how often" - ex. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, every minute. The captures with this script or front end are done in the background so you are not interrupted from the process.
